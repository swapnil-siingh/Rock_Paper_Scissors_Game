# Rock Paper Scissors Game

This is a basic Rock Paper Scissors game created as a part of my early web development journey. It's a web-based game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How to Play

1. **Clone the Repository:** To get started, clone this repository to your local machine.

2. **Open `rps.html`:** Open the `rps.html` file in your web browser.

3. **Game Rules:**
   - Click on your choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors).
   - The computer will make its choice.
   - The game will determine the winner based on the rules: Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, and Paper beats Rock.
   - The result will be displayed on the screen, indicating whether you win, lose, or tie.
   - There is also an autoplay option to avoid clicking again and again and leet the computer do all work.

4. **Play Again:** After each round, repeat the same procedure to play again.

## Project Structure

- `rps.html`: The main HTML file that displays the game interface and handles user interactions.
- `rps.css`: The CSS file for styling the game elements.
- `rps.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the game logic and handles user choices and computer selections.

## Future Improvements

This project is a basic implementation of Rock Paper Scissors. Here are some potential improvements you can explore:

- Adding more advanced game features.
- Enhancing the user interface and design.
- Implementing multiplayer functionality.
- Adding animations and sound effects for a more engaging experience.

Feel free to fork this project and make your own enhancements!
